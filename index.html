Curriculum Redefined is a project designed to enhance student experience through the evaluation of a comprehensive Curriculum and Portfolio Enhancement project. The assessment will be facilitated by a mixed methods approach that utilises both qualitive and quantitative analysis.

In this part of the research, NLP will underpin a mulit-query-able historic qualitative database that will aid in the projects objectives. Specifically, this work will examine the lexical evolution of module descriptions and syllabi from 2017 - 2024 to understand if the enhancement project is reflected in the language used, and how this can be used as a proxy to understand the impact of curriculum enhancement on different demographics and student outcomes.
